## ðŸŽ¯ **Interview Q&A Flashcards**

### AWS Infrastructure & Networking
**Q:** What is the difference between a Region and an AZ?  
**A:** A Region is a geographical area, and an AZ is an isolated data center within a region. Regions have multiple AZs for high availability.

**Q:** How does a NAT Gateway differ from an Internet Gateway?  
**A:** IGW allows inbound/outbound traffic for public subnets; NAT Gateway allows outbound internet for private subnets but blocks inbound.

---

### EC2 & Storage
**Q:** What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?  
**A:** EBS is persistent block storage; Instance Store is ephemeral and lost when the instance stops.

**Q:** How do EBS snapshots work?  
**A:** Snapshots are incremental â€” only changed blocks are saved after the first full backup.

---

### Load Balancing & Scaling
**Q:** ALB vs NLB?  
**A:** ALB works at Layer 7, supports HTTP/S routing and advanced features; NLB works at Layer 4, faster, handles TCP/UDP traffic.

**Q:** What is horizontal scaling?  
**A:** Adding more instances; vertical scaling means upgrading instance size.

---

### S3 & CDN
**Q:** How is durability different from availability in S3?  
**A:** Durability means data is not lost (99.999999999%), availability is how often it can be accessed.

**Q:** How does CloudFront reduce latency?  
**A:** By caching content in edge locations close to users.

---

### IAM & Security
**Q:** Role vs User?  
**A:** User has long-term credentials; Role has temporary credentials, usually assumed by AWS services or other accounts.

**Q:** What wins in IAM policy evaluation?  
**A:** Explicit Deny always overrides any Allow.

---

### Serverless & Event-Driven
**Q:** What is a Lambda cold start?  
**A:** Delay when a Lambda function is invoked after being idle, as AWS provisions the execution environment.

**Q:** REST API vs HTTP API in API Gateway?  
**A:** REST API is feature-rich but more expensive; HTTP API is cheaper and faster for most use cases.

---

### Monitoring & Automation
**Q:** CloudWatch vs CloudTrail?  
**A:** CloudWatch monitors performance metrics/logs; CloudTrail logs API calls for auditing.

**Q:** How can AWS CLI be used for automation?  
**A:** By scripting repetitive AWS commands, e.g., provisioning EC2, managing S3 buckets.

## ðŸ“Œ Additional AWS Interview Questions

### AWS Infrastructure & Networking
**Q:** What is VPC Peering?  
**A:** A network connection between two VPCs that allows them to communicate privately without using the internet.

**Q:** Can two VPCs in different regions be peered?  
**A:** Yes, using inter-region VPC peering.

**Q:** What is AWS PrivateLink?  
**A:** A way to securely access services over AWSâ€™s private network without exposing them to the public internet.

---

### EC2 & Storage
**Q:** What is the difference between gp3 and gp2 EBS volumes?  
**A:** gp3 offers baseline 3000 IOPS and cheaper pricing compared to gp2 with performance scaling based on size.

**Q:** What is an AMI?  
**A:** An Amazon Machine Image, a template containing the OS, application server, and apps for launching EC2 instances.

**Q:** How can you reduce EC2 costs?  
**A:** Use Spot Instances, Reserved Instances, right-sizing, and Auto Scaling.

---

### Load Balancing & Scaling
**Q:** How does ALB perform path-based routing?  
**A:** It routes traffic to different target groups based on the URL path in the request.

**Q:** What are ELB health check states?  
**A:** Healthy, Unhealthy, Initial, Draining.

**Q:** What is the cooldown period in Auto Scaling?  
**A:** A time delay after scaling to prevent rapid scaling actions.

---

### S3 & CDN
**Q:** What are S3 Event Notifications?  
**A:** Triggers that send events to services like Lambda, SNS, or SQS when objects are created or deleted.

**Q:** How is data encrypted in S3 by default?  
**A:** By default, itâ€™s not encrypted; you must enable SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C.

**Q:** What is the max object size in S3?  
**A:** 5TB, but for objects over 5GB you must use multipart upload.

---

### IAM & Security
**Q:** What is the difference between an inline and a managed policy?  
**A:** Inline is embedded directly into one user/group/role; managed is reusable across multiple entities.

**Q:** What is the AWS root user?  
**A:** The initial account with full access; should be protected with MFA and rarely used.

**Q:** What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?  
**A:** AWS secures the infrastructure, customers secure their applications and data.

---

### Serverless & Event-Driven

**A:** A serverless orchestration service to coordinate multiple AWS services into workflows.

**Q:** What is an API Gateway stage?  
**A:** A named environment (e.g., dev, test, prod) for API deployment.

**Q:** Can Lambda functions run in a VPC?  
**A:** Yes, but they need proper subnet and security group configurations.

---

### Monitoring & Automation
**Q:** What is a CloudWatch Alarm?  
**A:** A notification or action triggered when a metric crosses a defined threshold.

**Q:** What is AWS Config used for?  
**A:** Tracking and auditing resource configurations for compliance.

**Q:** What is the difference between AWS CLI and AWS SDK?  
**A:** CLI is for command-line operations; SDK is for integrating AWS services into code.

---

### Mixed Scenario Questions
**Q:** How would you make an EC2 instance in a private subnet download OS updates?  
**A:** Use a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance in a public subnet.

**Q:** How can you improve the durability of EC2 data beyond EBS snapshots?  
**A:** Replicate data to S3 or use cross-region replication.

**Q:** How would you design a multi-region S3 setup for low latency?  
**A:** Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) and CloudFront.
