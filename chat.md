# 🚀 AWS + DevOps Engineer Roadmap (3 Years Experience)

> A comprehensive skill-building guide to grow from a hands-on engineer to a cloud-native DevOps expert.

---

## 🎯 Goal:
Advance your skills to become a **Cloud DevOps Architect**, **Platform Engineer**, or **SRE** by mastering tools, cloud platforms, automation, CI/CD, and infrastructure at scale.

## 🧭 ROADMAP OVERVIEW

| Phase | Focus Area | Duration |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Core AWS & DevOps Skills | 2–3 months |
| Phase 2 | IaC, Automation & CI/CD | 2–3 months |
| Phase 3 | Containers & Kubernetes | 2–4 months |
| Phase 4 | Monitoring & Security | 2–3 months |
| Phase 5 | Architecture & Projects | 3–5 months |

## 🧱 Phase 1: Strengthen Core AWS & DevOps Skills

### 🟧 AWS Services:
- EC2 (Instances, AMIs, Launch Templates, ASG)
- VPC (Subnets, IGW, NAT, Route Tables, Security Groups)
- S3 (Lifecycle, Versioning, Hosting)
- IAM (Policies, Roles, MFA)
- Load Balancer (ALB, NLB)
- CloudWatch (Dashboards, Metrics, Alerts)
- CloudFormation Basics

### 🟦 DevOps Skills:
- Git (Branching, Merge, PRs)
- Jenkins (Freestyle & Declarative Pipelines)
- Docker (Images, Volumes, Networking)
- Linux (Permissions, Processes, Networking)
- Bash Scripting

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: IaC + CI/CD Automation

### 🟨 Terraform:
- Providers, Variables, Modules, Outputs
- State (Remote Backend: S3 + DynamoDB)
- Workspaces, Meta-Arguments (count, for_each)
- Use Cases: VPC, EC2, ASG, ALB

### 🟩 CI/CD:
- Jenkins Multistage Pipelines (Build → Test → Deploy)
- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI (YAML workflows)
- Integration with Docker and AWS

### 🟪 Config Management:
- Ansible (Playbooks, Roles, Inventories)

---

## ☸️ Phase 3: Containers & Kubernetes

### 🧊 Docker:
- Dockerfile Best Practices, Compose, Volumes
- Multi-stage builds

### ☸ Kubernetes (K8s):
- Pods, Deployments, Services
- ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ingress
- Probes, Resource Limits
- Helm (Charts & Templating)
- Namespaces, RBAC

### 🧠 AWS EKS:
- Provision with `eksctl` or Terraform
- Deploy microservices on EKS
- Integrate ALB Ingress Controller
- Monitor with Prometheus

---

## 🔐 Phase 4: Monitoring, Logging & Security

### 📊 Monitoring:
- CloudWatch Dashboards & Logs
- Prometheus + Grafana
- Loki or OpenSearch (Logging)

### 🔐 Security:
- IAM Roles/Policies & Trust Relationships
- AWS Config, GuardDuty, Inspector
- KMS, Secrets Manager, Parameter Store
- CI/CD pipeline hardening

---

## 🧠 Phase 5: Architecture & Real-World Projects

### 🧪 Build Projects:
- CI/CD Pipeline for K8s Microservices
- VPC with Bastion + NAT + ALB + RDS
- GitOps Deployment with Argo CD
- Full Infrastructure on Terraform
- Monitoring & Alerts for Production

### 🏗 Learn Design Patterns:
- HA, Fault Tolerance, Auto Scaling
- DR Strategies (Multi-AZ/Region)
- Service Mesh (Istio or Linkerd)
- Event-Driven (SQS/SNS + Lambda)
